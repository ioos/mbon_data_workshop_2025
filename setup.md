## Data Setup

Before attending the workshop we ask that you have:

1. Your "raw" data files:
   1. these are tables with your data.
   2. Data should include latitude, longitude, time, and taxonomic identification, among other things.
2. A programming environment: Participants should be ready to run python and/or R code to transform their data. Please set up an environment in advance as troubleshooting installation can take significant time.
   1. Recommended python setup guide: [link](https://ioos.github.io/ioos_code_lab/content/ioos_installation_conda.html).
   2. Recommended R setup guide: [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).
3. Created a GitHub issue [using this form](https://github.com/ioos/mbon_data_workshop_2025/issues/new?template=dataset_description.yaml). This helps us track datasets and document our work.

For 'Omics/eDNA data, see the [NOAA Omics Data Management Guide section on Study Data Templates](https://noaa-omics-dmg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/study-data-templates.html).
